# Knot-Exequivalence-project
Our project is a website that describes how to use snapPy so that you can use a python file in our git repository to determine if a knot the user drew is a prime knot, or an unknot.
Visit snappy.py and click on InstallSnapPy.exe or run A second option is to use the command "pip install snappy" in your terminal and run the "snappy --infile test_data/TGP_chrY --out test_SNAPPY" command to launch the application 
To create a knot in SnapPy, type the command M = Manifold() and it will open up the Plink interface. 
To draw a knot, click on the screen and click to a different spot to draw a line. 
To create an alternating crossing, go to tools and click reflect to pass a line under another. For example, cross over the lines you made once, and then before you draw the second crossing, click reflect to create a simple knot. 
Once you create a closed shape, click tools and then click send to SnapPy. Return to the terminal and run the command M.DT_code(). 
Once the command is run, click file and save as, and save the file and name the file myManifold into your downloads folder. 
Visit our GitHub and download blah and run the file on your computer.
